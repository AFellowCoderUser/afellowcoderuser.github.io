                    <p>I will just introduce you to what web hosting service you'll be using for your personal, static website right off the bat.</p>
                    <h2 style="text-align:center">NeoCities!</h2>
                    <a href="https://neocities.org/">
                        <img class="center" style="max-width:100%" src="/graphics/neocities_large.gif">
                    </a>

                    <p style="font-size:smaller;text-align:center">(This site was made with Github Pages, hence the domain.)</p>

                    <p>NeoCities is a free web hosting service for static pages. The free plan that it offers is pretty good depending on what website you are planning to host. 
                    The paid plan is also pretty good, only $5/mo and you're given more features like a *custom domain!</p>

                    <p style="font-size:smaller">*You'll need to purchase a domain first.</p>

                    <p>Now, to get started on NeoCities, create your account (of course). Once your account is created, your website is also created at the same time with all of the necessary files it needs. Now, hover and click over your username on the top-right corner and click on "Edit Site".</p>
                    <p>We'll be focusing on these two files:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>index.html</li>
                        <li>style.css</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>index.html is the main file of your website, anyone who types in the address of your website (like username.neocities.org, replace username with your own username) is directed to there. The file is also pre-written with html code so you're not stranded with a blank file. 
                    Same goes for the "style.css" file. The "index.html" file should already link the CSS file with <code>&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;/style.css&quot; /&gt;</code>. The <code>href=&quot;/style.css&quot;</code> is what specifies which CSS file it wants to get.
                    Every other HTML file that you've created on NeoCities will also be pre-written with the same code.</p>

                    <p>You can edit text files by hovering over the file on icon view, or by clicking on the red "Edit" button on list view.</p>

                    <h2 id="folders">Folders</h2>
                    <p>Folders are a great way to organize your website's files without it getting too cluttered. On the Edit Site page, you can create a new folder by clicking on the red button named "New Folder".</p>
                    <p class="note">
                        Let's say that you created a folder named "sites" and you create a HTML file named "main" within that folder. The HTML file can now be accessed with "username.neocities.org/sites/main".
                        However, if you wish for the link to say "username.neocities.org/sites" instead of "username.neocities.org/sites/main", change the HTML's file name within that folder to "index.html".
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="files">Files</h2>
                    <p>With a free account on NeoCities, you are restricted to what files you can upload. They do this because they are trying to grow sustainably and not become a file dump host. This restriction can be removed if you become a supporter. You can find the list of allowed files types <a href="https://neocities.org/site_files/allowed_types">here</a>.</p>
                    <p>Consider a website that is dedicated to file hosting, like <a href="https://filegarden.com/">File Garden</a>.</p>
                    <p>Now, you don't need to create every markup file on your computer then upload it to your NeoCities site. NeoCities has a handy "New File" button on the dashboard. Just type in the desired name of your file first then the file extention (.html, .css, .js, etc.).</p>

                    <h2 id="conclude">Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>NeoCities has other features out there for you to look for, such as downloading your entire site. (This can be very handy incase of your website suddenly disappears or something like that.) Take a look around NeoCities, from the Websites page to the Activity page! The sites there can either be made of personal reasons, to show off your media, to games, or to be very helpful in web development!</p>
                    <p>Your journey in web developing have just begun. Now, since you're done on reading this page, it's time for the next step, <a href="https://afellowcoderuser.github.io/learnhtml.html">learning HTML!</a></p>
