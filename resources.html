                    <p>There are many web development resources out there that can possibly explain more things much better and in detail.</p>


                    <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">MDN Documentation</a> - Excellant for referencing HTML/CSS/JS. Useful if you don't know what "this" means.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> - Has many coding tutorials and guides in various different programming languages.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://sadgrl.online/learn/" target="_blank">Sadgrl's webmaster guides</a> - A guide that explains some things mentioned in this website more in detail + HTML/CSS code snippets.</p>
                    
                    <p><a href="https://github.com/bcomnes/deploy-to-neocities" target="_blank">Deploy to NeoCities</a> - Although NeoCities has a feature where you can edit your site with a external code editor of your choice, you'll need a supporter plan to do such a thing. This is when Deploy to NeoCities comes in.</p>

                    <p>Deploy to NeoCities utilizes your website's API key to create, edit, and delete files on your website's storage. You can host all of your website's files on a Github repository and if you commit and push changes to your repository, a bot will gather all of the files and deploy those files in your website's storages via your website's API. This is much better than just going to the website then making changes to each file and saving. With Deploy to NeoCities, you can commit and push the changes all at once.</p>

                    <p><a href="https://github.com/AFellowCoderUser/afellowcoderuser.github.io" target="_blank">This site's repository</a> - You can use all of the code here as a reference on making your own website.</p>

                    <p><a href="https://filegarden.com/">File Garden</a> - Previously mentioned in the Intro page, this is a file hosting website. Useful if you want to free up storage space on your website's storage.</p>

                    <p>There's so much things to learn, but you'll eventually master it all! Your website WILL eventually evolve to the style that you wanted! Decorate it, make it interactive, it's your website!</p>
