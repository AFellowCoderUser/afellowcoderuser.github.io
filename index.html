                    <h1 style="text-align:center">Welcome to the Tebi Province!</h1>
                    <p>This site was made just for my B&T class, but this site also provides as a beginners guide to HTML and CSS! (No JS, sorry.) The top bar will bring you to a page dedicated to those two programming languages, have fun!</p>
                    <p>Also, it's up to me whether or not I should maintain this site, but I would try to keep it up.</p>

                    <h2 id="start">Getting Started</h2>
                    <p>Now, this guide focuses on making your own personal, static website, so if you're looking for a place where you can sell your stuff or something similar to that, this guide <b>is not</b> for you.</p>
                    <p>Now that's out of the way, I will just introduce you to what web hosting service you'll be using for your personal, static website right off the bat.</p>
                    <h2 style="text-align:center">Neocities!</h2>
                    <a href="https://neocities.org/">
                        <img src="/graphics/neocities_large.gif">
                    </a>
                    <p>Neocities is a free web hosting service for static pages. The free plan that it offers is pretty good depending on what website you are planning to host. 
                    The paid plan is also pretty good, only $5/mo and you're given more features like a custom domain!</p>

                    <p>Now, to get started on Neocities, create your account (of course). Once your account is created, your website is also created at the same time with all of the necessary files it needs.</p>
                    <p>We'll be focusing on these two files:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>index.html</li>
                        <li>style.css</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>index.html is the main file of your website, anyone who types in the address of your website (like username.neocities.org) is directed to there. The file is also pre-written with html code so you're not stranded with a blank file. 
                    Same goes for the "style.css" file, the "index.html" file should already link the css file with <code><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/style.css" /></code>.</p>
                </main>
