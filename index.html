                    <p>This site was made just for my B&T class, but this site also provides as a beginners guide to HTML and CSS! (No JS, sorry.) The top bar will bring you to a page dedicated to those two programming languages, have fun!</p>
                    <p>Also, it's up to me whether or not I should maintain this site, but I would try to keep it up.</p>

                    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                    <p>Now, this guide focuses on making your own personal, static website, so if you're looking for a place where you can sell your stuff or something similar to that, this guide <b>is not</b> for you.</p>
                    <p>Now that's out of the way, I will just introduce you to what web hosting service you'll be using for your personal, static website right off the bat.</p>
