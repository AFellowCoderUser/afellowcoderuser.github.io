                    <p>This site was made just for my B&T class, but this site also provides as a beginners guide to HTML and CSS! (No JS, sorry.) The top bar will bring you to a page dedicated to those two programming languages, have fun!</p>
                    <p>Also, it's up to me whether or not I should maintain this site, but I would try to keep it up.</p>

                    <p>Now, this guide focuses on making your own personal, static website, so if you're looking for a place where you can sell your stuff or something similar to that, this guide <b>is not</b> for you.</p>
                    
                    <p>With that out of the way, let's get <a href="https://afellowcoderuser.github.io/start.html">started</a>.</p>
